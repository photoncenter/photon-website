				<h2>Community Points FAQ</h2>

				<details>
					<summary>Will Community Points be available on mobile apps?</summary>
					<p>Currently, Community Points is only available on desktop versions of the website but it will be supported on the iOS and Android apps. However, new features may appear on desktop versions of the website before mobile, depending on development circumstances.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>How can I buy the subreddit banner?</summary>
					<p>Choose the link "Buy Banner" located on the right side of the subreddit's menu bar. You cannot see it or buy the banner while using the Reddit old design. Please enable Reddit Redesign to use Community Points.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>What happens if the subreddit banner's price is updated?</summary>
					<p>The current owner of the banner can update the price at any time. If the price is increased, the owner pays an additional tax corresponding to the price delta and duration of time that is left within the current tax period. If the owner decreases the price, then nothing happens.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Where goes the Photon used to buy the subreddit banner?</summary>
					<p>When someone buys the banner from you, the Photon will go to you. The daily tax paid while you're the owner of the banner will be burned.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Which images can be used with the subreddit banner?</summary>
					<p>Any images that violate Reddit's <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy" target="_blank">site policies</a> and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/wiki/rules" target="_blank">/r/Stellar rules</a> will be removed.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Are bot accounts excluded from Photon distribution?</summary>
					<p>Reddit bots such as /u/communitypoints and /u/automoderator do not receive Photon and they do not upvote or downvote any content in the subreddit. So, they do not influence Photon distribution or the amount each user receive.</p>
				</details>

				<h2>Community Poll FAQ</h2>

				<details>
					<summary>What community polls should be used for?</summary>
					<p>Community Polls should be used for anything regarding Community Points or subreddit governance. If you want to make a poll about your project, if it's a third party project not included or making use of the subreddit, you should contact the subreddit moderation as each subreddit may have its own set of rules and policy.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>How many options can I use in community polls?</summary>
					<p>You can use a minimum of 2 options and a maximum of 7 options per poll.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>What's the difference between a General Poll and a Governance Pool?</summary>
					<p>General Polls can be used for anything you'd like and it keeps running until the voting length ends. The winner option is selected by the number of votes <strong>when the poll voting is closed</strong>, on the last day of the number of days you specify.</p>
					<p>Governance Polls are auto-enacted and should be used for governance purposes. The winner option is selected <strong>as soon it reaches the Decision Threshold</strong>, during the number of days you specify. The Decision Threshold is based on the number of Photon that was previously voted in polls.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Are bot accounts excluded from Community Polls voting?</summary>
					<p>Reddit bots such as /u/communitypoints and /u/automoderator do not vote in community polls. So, they don't influence governance decisions made trough community polls.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>If I buy Photon in the free market can I use it to have voting power in governance polls?</summary>
					<p>No. If you buy Photon in the free market you will not be able to vote on polls with it. Your voting power is tied to the amount of Photon you legitimately won from the subreddit, not the total amount you hold from various sources.</p>
